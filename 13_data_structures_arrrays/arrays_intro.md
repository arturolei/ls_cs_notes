# Intro to Hashtables, Blockchain, and Arrays, 10 March 2020 

## Hashtables or a Hash Map
- Hash tables are like dictionaries, a collectiono of mappings of keys to values
- Constant time (O(n)) to add or to remove from a hash table 
- You can think of a Hash table as made up of:
  - an array, [] 
  - A hash function, f()

## Some Things to Know About Arrays: 
- Everything you need to know about arrays is that live/occupy space in memory; "they live somewhere on your computer hard drive"
- When you make a new array, you get a pointer to a slot in computer memory. 
- Adding to end of array is O(1)
- Adding to start of an array is O(n)
